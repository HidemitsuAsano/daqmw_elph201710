# setup for NIM-EASRIOC 
   1. go to the directory "daq_work"
   2. ln -s (NIMEASIROC's READER)/ruby1/Gemfile .
   3. su
   4. run "ruby/install.sh" from the directory where you run "run.py"
   5. exit

#  How to install DAQ softwares
   1. "cd daq-mw-app/daq"
   2. compile utility codes under "util/" and "util_easiroc/" at first.
   3. "cd component/HulScalerReader1/standalone" and compile those codes by "Makefile_lib"
      This makes library for HUL from Dr.Honda's codes.
   4. go back to "component/"
   5. type "make". This compiles all DAQ-MW components.

# How to start DAQ
  go to "daq_work"
  ./start_daq.sh
  or 
  run.py -cl config_all.xml

  if you want to run with webUI
  run.py -l config.xml

# How to check running component
  pgrep -fl Comp
