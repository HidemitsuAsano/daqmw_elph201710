This code relys on FPGAModule class in HUL standalone codes.
To include this class, shared library files should be created at first in standalone/src.
The Makefile file "Makefile_lib" should be used to do it.
After typing "make", libBitDump.so, libFPGAModule.so, libUDPRBCP.so are created under standalone/src directory.
